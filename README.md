# AC220 - Cassandra Data Modelling

## Scenario 1: Sensor Data Modeling

Interested in learning more about Cassandra data modeling by example? This example demonstrates how to create a data model for temperature monitoring sensor networks. It covers a conceptual data model, application workflow, logical data model, physical data model, and final CQL schema and query design.


**In this scenario, you will:**
* Learn how to create a data model for temperature monitoring sensor networks
* Create tables for a sensor data use case 
* Populate tables with sample sensor data
* Design and execute CQL queries over sensor data

_This scenario is also available on our [https://www.datastax.com/learn/data-modeling-by-example](https://www.datastax.com/learn/data-modeling-by-example) site, where you can find many more resources to help you succeed with Apache Cassandraâ„¢._
